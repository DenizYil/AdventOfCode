# authenticity is important because it is the ability of a system to ensure that the user is who they say they are
# and that the data is not altered in transit. If you do not have authenticity then you can't be sure that you are
# communicating with the intended recipient and that the data has not been tampered with. This can lead to a number
# of issues including the possibility of data being stolen or manipulated.
